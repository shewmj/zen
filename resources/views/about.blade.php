        I am an aspiring software developer who recently graduated from British Colombia Institute of Technology. 
        <br><br>
        Before BCIT I studied as an engineer. I never had any intention of being a developer or writing code for a living. My inital introduction to programming was overwhelming and frustrating. Everything seemed magic. Languages and libararies seemed countless and the possibilites endless. I hated it. It seeemed not only overwhelming but incredoubly tedious. Now I could not imagine wanting to work in a different industry. 
        <br><br>
        The same reasons I love programming are why I hated it to begin with. The Languages and libaries are countless, and the possibilities endless. There is a special kind of satisfaction when you create beautiful out of a couple hundred or thousand lines of characters. Even as a student I feel proud of my ability to design and build an idea into reality.
